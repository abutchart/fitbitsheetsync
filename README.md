A script that adds the sleep data from my Fitbit to a Google Sheet.
Originally written in January of 2019.

The script ran for 584 days until I got a new watch.
According to the data, on an average night I:

Slept an average of 7 hours and 1 minute
Took 49 minutes to fall asleep
Was awake for 15% of the sleep period
Was in REM for 18% of the sleep period
Was in light sleep for 49% of the sleep period
Was in deep sleep for 18% of the sleep period
